## agency-index.json

The SHARE IT Act requires federal agencies to publish metadata for their software projects. This metadata is compiled into an **agency-index.json** file, which serves as a centralized inventory of the agency's software portfolio.


Agency index files are found here: https://github.com/DSACMS/code-gov/tree/main/agency-indexes
