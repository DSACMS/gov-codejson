# Examples of code.json

Below are examples of well-structured and comprehensive metadata in CMS code.json files. These examples demonstrate best practices for repository-level metadata documentation.

For additional reference, the [tests directory](../schemas/tests) contain unit tests of code.json files from various DSACMS repositories. These tests help ensure consistency and compliance as we make future updates to the schemas.

We encourage you to review these examples and tests when creating or updating your repository-level code.json file to maintain consistency with federal standards.

## Example 1: [DedupliFHIR](https://github.com/DSACMS/dedupliFHIR)

DedupliFHIR is a desktop app tool that uses AI deduplication to identify duplicates in patient records. It is a [tier 3](https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder/blob/dev/maturity-model-tiers.md#tier-information) project launched in production that receives user input.

## Example 2: [CMS Metrics Website](https://github.com/DSACMS/metrics)

The CMS Metrics Website is a [tier 3](https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder/blob/dev/maturity-model-tiers.md#tier-information) project where government employees can view repository metrics on CMS open source projects, currently maintained by the CMS OSPO.

## Example 3: [gov-codejson](https://github.com/DSACMS/gov-codejson)

gov-codejson (this repository!) is a [tier 3](https://github.com/DSACMS/repo-scaffolder/blob/dev/maturity-model-tiers.md#tier-information) project containing documentation on the code.json metadata standard, currently maintained by the federal government community.
